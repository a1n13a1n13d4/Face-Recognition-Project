## Face Recognition from Uploaded Video

### About

This project processes uploaded video files, identifying and tracking faces using pre-trained models. Each frame is analyzed to detect faces, which are then matched against a known database.

### Requirements

You'll need:
- **Google Colab** for running the project.
- **Python 3.6+** as your environment.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a1n13a1n13d4/Face-Recognition-Project.git
   cd Face-Recognition-Project
   ```

2. **Open in Google Colab:**
   - Upload the repository to your Google Drive.
   - Open the `Face_Recognition_From_Upload_Video` notebook in Google Colab.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```python
   !pip install numpy opencv-python dlib face_recognition imutils
   ```

### Usage

1. **Upload your video file** to Google Drive.
2. **Update the script**:
   - Modify `video_path` in the script to point to your uploaded video.
3. **Run the script**:
   - Process the video, and the output will be saved in the specified directory.

### Results

The processed video with recognized faces will be saved to your Google Drive, along with a log file detailing detected faces and matches.

## Live Face Recognition via Webcam

### About

This project provides real-time face recognition via webcam, detecting and identifying faces against a pre-trained model.

### Requirements

You'll need:
- **Anaconda Navigator** to manage dependencies.
- **Python 3.6+** as your environment.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a1n13a1n13d4/Face-Recognition-Project.git
   cd Face-Recognition-Project
   ```

2. **Create and activate a new Anaconda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n face_recognition_env python=3.6
   conda activate face_recognition_env
   ```

3. **Navigate to the webcam project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Live_Face_Recognition_Via_Webcam
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy opencv-python dlib face_recognition imutils
   ```

### Usage

1. Ensure your webcam is properly set up.
2. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python live_face_recognition.py
   ```

The webcam feed will show real-time face detection and recognition.

### Results

The results are displayed live and logged to a file for future reference.
