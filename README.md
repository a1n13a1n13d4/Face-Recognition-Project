## Face Recognition from Uploaded Video

### About

This project processes uploaded video files, identifying and tracking faces using pre-trained models. Each frame is analyzed to detect faces, which are then matched against a known database.

### Requirements

You'll need:
- **Google Colab** for running the project.
- **Python 3.6+** as your environment.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a1n13a1n13d4/Face-Recognition-Project.git
   cd Face-Recognition-Project
   ```

2. **Open in Google Colab:**
   - Upload the repository to your Google Drive.
   - Open the `Face_Recognition_From_Upload_Video` notebook in Google Colab.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```python
   !pip install numpy opencv-python dlib face_recognition imutils
   ```

### Usage

1. **Upload your video file** to Google Drive.
2. **Update the script**:
   - Modify `video_path` in the script to point to your uploaded video.
3. **Run the script**:
   - Process the video, and the output will be saved in the specified directory.

### Results

The processed video with recognized faces will be saved to your Google Drive, along with a log file detailing detected faces and matches.

## Live Face Recognition via Webcam

### About

This project provides real-time face recognition via webcam, detecting and identifying faces against a pre-trained model.

### Requirements

You'll need:
- **Anaconda Navigator** to manage dependencies.
- **Python 3.6+** as your environment.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a1n13a1n13d4/Face-Recognition-Project.git
   cd Face-Recognition-Project
   ```

2. **Create and activate a new Anaconda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n face_recognition_env python=3.6
   conda activate face_recognition_env
   ```

3. **Navigate to the webcam project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Live_Face_Recognition_Via_Webcam
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy opencv-python dlib face_recognition imutils
   ```

### Usage

1. Ensure your webcam is properly set up.
2. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python live_face_recognition.py
   ```

The webcam feed will show real-time face detection and recognition.

### Results

The results are displayed live and logged to a file for future reference.

# Sign Language Digit Recognition via Webcam

## About

This project provides real-time sign language digit recognition via a webcam. It generates a random 5-digit number and prompts the user to sign each digit sequentially. The system verifies if the signed digits match the generated number and provides feedback on the accuracy.

## Requirements

You'll need:

- A Python 3.9.13
- A virtual environment manager (recommended: `venv`).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sign-Language-Digit-Recognition.git
   cd Sign-Language-Digit-Recognition
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv envir
   ```

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     envir\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source envir/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install mediapipe==0.9.1 opencv-python==4.7.0.72 numpy==1.21.4
   ```

## Usage

1. **Ensure Your Webcam is Properly Set Up**

   Make sure your webcam is connected and operational.

2. **Run the Script**

   ```bash
   python Sign_Detection.py
   ```

3. **How It Works**

   - The script generates a random 5-digit number consisting of digits 1-5.
   - For each digit, the script displays the digit to be signed and waits for the user to sign it.
   - The system uses MediaPipe to detect and recognize hand gestures.
   - The detected gestures are checked against the expected digits, and feedback is provided.

4. **Stopping the Program**

   - To stop the program at any time, press the 'q' key while the video window is open.

## Results

- **Real-Time Feedback**: The system provides live feedback on whether the signed digits match the generated number.
- **Logging**: Results are displayed on the terminal and can be customized to log to a file if needed.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Video Feed**:
  - Ensure your webcam is properly connected and accessible.
  - Check if other applications are using the webcam.

- **Import Errors**:
  - Verify that all required packages are installed in the virtual environment.

- **Gesture Recognition Not Accurate**:
  - Update the `detect_gesture()` function with more accurate gesture recognition logic using MediaPipe landmarks.

### Guidelines

- **Code Style:** Ensure your code adheres to the projectâ€™s coding style and conventions.
- **Documentation:** Include appropriate comments and documentation for your changes, especially if introducing new features or modifying existing ones.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for any new functionality, and ensure that all existing tests pass before submitting your pull request.

Thank you for your interest in contributing!
